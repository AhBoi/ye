            <p>Internet to store and handle critical data, the more vigilant we must be in protecting it from cybercriminals. As a DISM student, students will have a competitive advantage in your future studies and career. students will learn many cybersecurity-related things, including offensive threats, defensive strategies, and investigation techniques. In this course, many activities can be experienced. The Cyber Wargame Centre will use a cyber wargame approach to teach students how to deal with real-world security situations like intrusion detection, incident response, forensics analysis, and risk mitigation. This course would allow students to get recognised by the industry, as they would get many highly recognised certiﬁcates, allowing them to have a greater chance of joining their desired job sector. Furthermore, students don’t have to have prior coding knowledge to join this course, so even if you are a newbie in coding, you are still able to excel in this course.</p>

            <h1>What have I been learning?</h1>
            <p>So far, not all the modules for semester 1 are directly related to the course, like the module Communicating For Project Effectiveness is not related to coding at all, however, it is a useful module, to teach you how to create a proposal in the future. However, there are modules related, such as Fundamentals of Programming. The course teaches basic codes, which is perfect for beginners. I am also learning front-end web development, which teaches me how to design and create basic websites using only HTML and Cascading Style Sheets or more commonly known as CSS. So far, the modules have not been too overwhelming, and I am still able to have some time to myself, to relax and release some steam. Overall, I do not regret joining this course.</p>
