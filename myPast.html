            <h1>Primary School</h1>
            <p>I attended two different primary schools, Queenstown Primary School and Teck Whye Primary School. I only attended Queenstown for around half a year before attending Teck Whye. I was in the scouts CCA for around 2 years from primary 1 to primary 2 before quitting and later joining basketball at primary 5. Generally, my studies were not great but not bad as well. I always did well for my math and sciences but did pretty badly for my languages. I got 207 for my PSLE aggregate score.</p>

            <h1>Secondary School</h1>
            <p>I attended Regent Secondary School express stream. Generally, I can't say that my grades were bad. My O level wasn’t the best, however, I am still pretty proud of myself for getting 9 net points. I was in the Entrepreneur club for the entirety of secondary one before realising that I did not have an interest in it, joined the Infocomm club, which was where I found my passion in coding. That was when I ﬁrst started learning how to code in python. I fell in love with it instantly, and when we were told to create our project, I was super excited, and together with my group of friends, we spent roughly around 8h creating an 800 lines code to create an entire shoe shop, which consisted of over  20 shoes in total for both the male and female gender. It was ﬁlled with tons of bugs, considering that it was our ﬁrst time. However, after another huge number of hours debugging and testing the code, it ﬁnally worked! That’s when I felt this huge sense of accomplishment and that was when I knew I had to join a coding related course in the future.</p>

            <h1>Personal Life</h1>
            <p>Generally, my studies are pretty good, and I would always get top 10% in my cohort every single year since primary 1. I’ve gotten the eagles award in 2020 after my graduation. I’ve participated in the many Math Olympiad and Australian Math Competitions throughout the years, sadly only getting silver once for Math Olympiad. I participated in many competitions, including Singapore Junior Water Prize 2020, in collaboration with another classmate. We worked hard and reached the top few students, however, we sadly did not get the ﬁrst few places, and only received the certiﬁcate of participation.</p>
